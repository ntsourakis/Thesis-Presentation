| This is my thesis presentation that was presented at Geneva University in October 2013. |
| It was created with HTML5 using the following frameworks:				  |
|											  |
| 1) impress.js (https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/)					  |
| 2) Chart.js (http://www.chartjs.org/)							  |	
|											  |
| There are various issues when testing the presentation in different browsers.           |
| So, it might not look as you expected in yours.					  |
| I used Firefox v24.0 and this is how it looks: http://youtu.be/CHNhTFlJIG4     	  |

| In order to see the whole structure of the presentaion, in css/style.css change line:	  |
|											  |
| .impress-supported .step{opacity:0.05}					   	  |
| 											  |											|
| to											  |
|											  |
| .impress-supported .step{opacity:1}							  |
